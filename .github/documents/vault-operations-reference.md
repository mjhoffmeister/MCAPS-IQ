# Vault Operations Reference

Detailed reference for OIL workflows. Use
`.github/instructions/obsidian-vault.instructions.md` for day-to-day runtime behavior.

## Layout Guidance

- Preferred customer layout: `Customers/<Name>/<Name>.md`
- Entity sub-notes:
  - `Customers/<Name>/opportunities/<Opp>.md`
  - `Customers/<Name>/milestones/<Ms>.md`

## Frontmatter Notes

- IDs and machine-readable fields belong in frontmatter.
- Narrative context belongs in note body sections.
- Keep owner names aligned with `People/<Name>.md` filenames.

## Deep Workflow Notes

### VAULT-PREFETCH

- First pull customer context.
- Then derive CRM filters from vault IDs.

### VAULT-SYNC

- Read vault entities.
- Diff with CRM result set.
- Write only deltas.

### VAULT-HYGIENE

- Run `check_vault_health`.
- Review `structuralIssues` and stale entities.
- Propose migrations and targeted repairs.

## Safety Reminders

- Avoid direct bulk markdown generation for entities.
- Prefer entity-aware OIL tools for auditability.
- Use pending write review for non-trivial change sets.
