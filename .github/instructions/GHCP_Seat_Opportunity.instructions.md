## Key Formulas

### GHCP Seat Opportunity (historically called TAM / Whitespace)

The total addressable developer seats within an account:

```
Seat Oppty = MAX(GHE License Seats + GHE Metered Seats, ADO Seats)
```

- If `(GHE License + GHE Metered) > ADO Seats` → Seat Oppty = GHE total
- Otherwise → Seat Oppty = ADO Seats
- Calculated at the **account (TPID) level**. Group totals = sum of per-account maxima (not max of aggregated totals).

### Remaining Seat Opportunity

The potential for additional GHCP seats after accounting for actuals and all pipeline:

```
Remaining Seat Opp = Seat Oppty − GHCP Seats − Qualified Pipeline Seats − Unqualified Pipeline Seats
```

- **Qualified Pipeline Seats**: estimated monthly seats from milestones beyond the earliest sales stage, with approved statuses (On Track / At Risk / Blocked / Completed), in POC/Pilot or Production categories, in open fiscal periods. Converted using the Seat Ratio ($16/seat).
- **Unqualified Pipeline Seats**: estimated seats from milestones at the earliest sales stage (Sales Stage Number = 1).
- The report column "Remaining GHCP Seat Opp" reflects this full subtraction, which is why simple `Seat Oppty − GHCP Seats` does **not** match.

### GHCP Attach Rate

```
GHCP Attach = GHCP Seats / GHCP Seat Opportunity
```

### ARPU (Average Revenue Per User)

```
ARPU = GHCP ACR ($) / GHCP Seats
```

## Worked Example — TPID 719650 (Millennium Partners)

| Metric | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| GHE License Seats | 3,753 | MSXI Acc. View |
| GHE Metered Seats | 0 | MSXI Acc. View |
| ADO Seats | 8 | MSXI Acc. View |
| **GHCP Seat Oppty** | **3,753** | MAX(3753 + 0, 8) = 3,753 |
| GHCP Seats | 1,282 | MSXI Acc. View |
| Qualified GH Seats FY26 (open) | 63 | MSXI pipeline data |
| Unqualified Pipeline Seats | ~937 | Inferred (see below) |
| **Remaining GHCP Seat Opp** | **1,471** | 3,753 − 1,282 − 63 − ~937 |

**Why Seat Oppty − GHCP Seats ≠ Remaining Seat Opp:**
- Naive subtraction: 3,753 − 1,282 = 2,471
- Report shows: 1,471 (a difference of 1,000)
- The PBI model subtracts both qualified AND unqualified pipeline seats from the opportunity, not just actuals. The pipeline seat values come from milestone-level calculations and are not directly visible as separate columns in the Acc. View export. Use the pipeline/milestone views in MSXI to see the breakdown.

## GHCP Growth Framework (Cohort Definitions)

| Cohort | Name | Criteria | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| **0** | No GHE/ADO/GHCP | No GHE licenses, no ADO, no GHCP seats | Land Copilot |
| **1** | GHE/ADO, limited GHCP | GHE and/or ADO present, < 50 GHCP seats | Land Copilot |
| **2** | >50 GHCP, <50% attached | GHE/ADO present, > 50 GHCP seats, < 50% attach | Expand Copilot |
| **3** | >50 GHCP, >50% attach, <$30 ARPU | Strong adoption but low monetization | Upsell to Enterprise |
| **4** | >50 GHCP, >50% attach, >$30 ARPU | High-value, well-penetrated | Nurture & Cross-sell |

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Remaining ≠ Seat Oppty − GHCP Seats.** The PBI model also subtracts qualified and unqualified pipeline seats. Always check pipeline views for the full breakdown.
2. **Seat Oppty ≠ GHE Total Seats** in general. It equals GHE Total only when GHE > ADO. For ADO-heavy accounts, Seat Oppty = ADO Seats.
3. **Group-level Seat Oppty** is the sum of per-account MAX values, not MAX of aggregated GHE/ADO totals.
4. **Seat Targets** are authoritative only at Field Accountability Unit (area) and STB Mid-Segment (segment) levels. Lower-level values are derived approximations.
5. **New Logo ACR excludes PRU.** Remove PRU revenue when comparing against new logo thresholds.
6. **Strategic Pillar ACR ≠ GHCP ACR** — the pillar view includes PRU revenue.
