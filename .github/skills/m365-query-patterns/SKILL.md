# M365 Query Patterns

Efficient patterns for Calendar, Mail, and Teams MCP tools. For **broad multi-source discovery** across meetings + chats + email + files in one sweep, use the `workiq-operations` skill instead.

---

## Calendar (`calendar:*`)

### Critical Rule

**Always use `ListCalendarView` with explicit start/end datetimes.** `ListEvents` is unbounded and doesn't expand recurring events.

### Tools

| Tool | Purpose | Risk |
|---|---|---|
| `ListCalendarView` | Events in a time window | LOW (bounded) |
| `GetUserDateAndTimeZoneSettings` | User timezone | LOW |
| `FindMeetingTimes` | Available slots for attendees | LOW |
| `GetRooms` | Meeting rooms | LOW |
| `CreateEvent` | Create event (sends invites) | WRITE |
| `UpdateEvent` / `CancelEvent` / `DeleteEventById` | Modify/remove | WRITE |
| `AcceptEvent` / `DeclineEvent` / `TentativelyAcceptEvent` | Respond | WRITE |

### Patterns

**Today's schedule**: `GetUserDateAndTimeZoneSettings` → `ListCalendarView` with today's boundaries.

**Find available time**: `FindMeetingTimes` with attendees + time range + duration (ISO 8601: `PT1H`, `PT30M`).

**Room booking**: `GetRooms` → include room as attendee/location in `CreateEvent`.

**Create meeting**: `CreateEvent` with `isOnlineMeeting: true` for auto Teams link.

**Cancel vs Delete**: `CancelEvent` notifies attendees (organizer). `DeleteEventById` silently removes (attendee).

### OrderBy

Use **PascalCase**: `Start`, `End`, `Subject` — NOT `start/dateTime`.

## Mail (`mail:*`)

### Search (KQL)

Always include at least 2 filters. Always include a date range.

| KQL | Example |
|---|---|
| `from:` | `from:satyan@microsoft.com` |
| `subject:` | `subject:"Quarterly Review"` |
| `received:` | `received:2026-03-01..2026-03-14` |
| `hasattachment:true` | Messages with attachments |
| `isflagged:true` / `isread:false` | Flagged / unread |

**Two-pass**: `SearchMessages` (top: 5-10) → `GetMessage` for specific IDs.

### Attachment Safety

1. `GetAttachments` first — check names and sizes.
2. Skip >5MB unless explicitly requested.
3. `UploadLargeAttachment` for files >3MB.

### Write Patterns

| Action | Tool |
|---|---|
| New email | `SendEmailWithAttachments` |
| Reply | `ReplyToMessage` / `ReplyAllToMessage` |
| Reply with thread | `ReplyWithFullThread` / `ReplyAllWithFullThread` |
| Forward | `ForwardMessage` / `ForwardMessageWithFullThread` |
| Draft workflow | `CreateDraftMessage` → `UpdateDraft` → `SendDraftMessage` |

### Payload Management

- Always use `top` on `SearchMessages` (start: 5-10).
- Always include date range in KQL.
- Prefer `ReplyToMessage` over `ReplyWithFullThread` when recipient has context.

## Teams (`teams:*`)

### Chat Topology

| Type | `chatType` | ID Pattern | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1:1 direct | `oneOnOne` | `19:<hex>@thread.v2` | Permanent, not meeting-tied |
| Group | `group` | `19:<hex>@thread.v2` | 3+ participants |
| Meeting | `meeting` | `19:meeting_<base64>@thread.v2` | Calendar event thread |
| Self-chat | N/A | `48:notes` | Not in `ListChats` |

**Critical**: Meeting chats are often named "1:1 - [Name]" but their IDs contain `meeting_`. **Never rely on display names** — check the ID.

### UPN Resolution (Vault-First)

```
1. oil:get_person_context({ name }) → email / teams_id?
   └ Found → USE IT
2. teams:SearchTeamsMessages → find chatIds → ListChatMembers → extract email + userId
3. calendar:ListCalendarView → extract UPN from attendees
4. All fail → ASK USER
5. ALWAYS persist discovered UPNs to vault via oil:patch_note
```

**Never guess UPNs from aliases.** `jinle@microsoft.com` ≠ `jin.lee@microsoft.com`.

### Retrieval Patterns

**Topic search**: `SearchTeamsMessages` with `top: 5-10` → extract chatId/channelId for drill-down.

**Person's direct messages**: Vault UPN → `ListChats` (filter `chatType == "oneOnOne"`) → `ListChatMessages`.

**Channel content**: `ListTeams` → `ListChannels` → `ListChannelMessages`. Cache teamId/channelId.

### Write Patterns

**Post to chat**: Verify chatId first (`GetChat` if unsure). Confirm chatType matches intent. `PostMessage`.

**Post to channel**: `PostChannelMessage` with teamId + channelId.

**Reply in thread**: `ReplyToChannelMessage` with teamId + channelId + parent messageId.

**Create chat**: Resolve all member UPNs via vault first. `CreateChat` with chatType + members.

### Payload Management

- Always set `top` on `SearchTeamsMessages` (start: 5-10).
- Search results can exceed 20KB due to HTML/adaptive cards.
- Use search only for ID discovery, then `GetChatMessage` for specific content.
