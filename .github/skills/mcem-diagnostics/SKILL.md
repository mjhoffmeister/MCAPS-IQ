# MCEM Diagnostics

Pinpoints the functional MCEM stage by reading CRM entity state and validates exit criteria against Verifiable Outcomes — all in one pass.

## Freedom Level

**Medium** — VO interpretation requires judgment; exit-criteria checks are rule-based.

## Modes

| Mode | Trigger Keywords | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Identify** | which stage, what stage, stage mismatch, diagnose | Determine functional vs. declared stage |
| **Validate** | exit criteria, are we ready, VO audit, ready to advance | Check criteria for progression |

Both modes run by default. If user only asks "which stage" without mentioning exit criteria, **identify** mode can run standalone.

## Flow

1. Call `msx-crm:crm_get_record` on opportunity for stage, solution play, success plan, `activestageid`.
2. Call `msx-crm:get_milestones` with `opportunityId` for milestone state.
3. **Stage identification** — compare CRM artifacts against MCEM exit criteria:

| Transition | Evidence Required |
|---|---|
| Stage 1 → 2 | Qualified opportunity exists + solution play selected |
| Stage 2 → 3 | CSP created + business value reviewed + plays confirmed |
| Stage 3 → 4 | Customer agreement + resources aligned (`msp_commitmentrecommendation = 861980003`) |
| Stage 4 → 5 | Solution delivered (`msp_milestonestatus = 861980003`) + health metrics agreed |

   - **Non-linear rule**: If CRM Stage says "Stage 3" but no CSP or Business Value Assessment found → label as **Functional Stage 2 (At Risk)**.

4. **Exit criteria validation** — for the current/target stage gate, map achieved VOs:

| Gate | Criterion | CRM Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| 1→2 | Qualified opportunity | `opportunity.statecode = 0` + `activestageid` past qualification |
| 1→2 | Solution play selected | `opportunity.msp_salesplay ne null` |
| 2→3 | Plays confirmed | `opportunity.msp_salesplay` valid value |
| 2→3 | Business value reviewed | BVA entity `status = Complete` |
| 2→3 | CSP created | `msp_successplan` linked |
| 3→4 | Customer agreement | `opportunity.activestageid` post-commitment |
| 3→4 | Resources aligned | `msp_commitmentrecommendation = 861980003` + `msp_milestonedate` set |
| 4→5 | Solution delivered | `msp_milestonestatus = 861980003` |
| 4→5 | Health metrics agreed | CSP health fields populated |

5. Report pass/fail per criterion. Flag BPF stage divergence from VO-based stage.

## Decision Logic

- **All criteria met** → stage progression supported, recommend next-stage skills
- **Partial** → list specific gaps with remediation actions and accountable role
- **BPF vs. functional divergence** → flag discrepancy explicitly as highest-priority finding
- Route gaps to the accountable role for the current stage (ATU→STU→CSU per MCEM model)

## Output Schema

- `current_crm_stage`: stage reflected in MSX/D365
- `functional_mcem_stage`: stage supported by verifiable outcomes
- `outcome_gaps`: numbered list of missing exit criteria
- `criteria_results`: pass/fail per criterion with CRM evidence (validate mode)
- `overall_readiness`: ready | not_ready | partial
- `bpf_vs_vo_discrepancy`: flag if declared stage differs from evidence-based stage
- `recommended_lead`: which role should lead next steps based on functional stage
- `next_action`: names the appropriate skill for gap remediation or next-stage entry
