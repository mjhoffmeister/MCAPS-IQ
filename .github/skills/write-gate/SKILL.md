# MSX Role Mapping + Write Confirmation Gate

## Scope
Applies when working with MSX/MCEM CRM workflows, especially write-intent tools:
`crm_auth_status`, `crm_whoami`, `crm_get_record`, `crm_query`, `get_milestones`, `get_milestone_activities`,
`create_task`, `update_task`, `close_task`, `update_milestone`

## 0) CRM Read Scoping (Required before bulk reads)
Before calling any CRM read tool that may return large result sets:
1. **VAULT-PREFETCH first**: If OIL is available, call `get_customer_context({ customer })` for the target customer.
2. **Confirm the user's role** (see §1 below).
3. **Prefer `get_milestones` with name resolution**: Use `customerKeyword` or `opportunityKeyword`.
4. Only use `get_milestones(mine: true)` if the user explicitly requests all milestones.

## 1) Role Resolution (Required before workflow guidance)
1. Identify current user via `crm_auth_status` (or `crm_whoami`).
2. Fetch profile data using `crm_get_record` for `systemusers(<userId>)`.
3. Map the user to one of: Specialist, Solution Engineer, Cloud Solution Architect, Customer Success Account Manager.
4. If mapping is ambiguous: Present top 1–2 likely roles with reasons and ask the user to confirm.
5. If mapping is unknown: Ask the user which role workflow to apply.

## 2) Role-Bound Execution Rules
Use the selected role skill as the primary workflow contract for boundary decisions, stage/ownership checks, handoff format, and escalation triggers.

## 2a) Role-Action Authority Matrix (Mandatory pre-write check)

| Action | Allowed Roles | Blocked Roles (must redirect) |
|---|---|---|
| `create_milestone` | **Specialist** | SE, CSA, CSAM — redirect to Specialist |
| `update_milestone` (structure) | **Specialist**, **CSAM** (Stage 4-5 only) | SE, CSA — redirect to Specialist/CSAM |
| `update_milestone` (status only) | **Specialist**, **CSAM**, **CSA** | SE — redirect to milestone owner |
| `create_task` | **All roles** (on milestones they touch) | — |
| `update_task` | **Task owner**, or role that created it | Other roles — redirect to task owner |
| `close_task` | **Task owner**, or role that created it | Other roles — redirect to task owner |
| Opportunity field updates | **Specialist** | SE, CSA, CSAM — redirect to Specialist |
| Deal team membership | **Specialist**, **self-add by any role** | — |

**Enforcement rule**: When the agent detects a gap (e.g., "this milestone has no tasks"), the recommendation must respect the matrix.

## 3) Mandatory Plan Mode for Write-Intent Actions

### 3a) Picklist Field Mapping (Required for milestone create/update)
1. **Map all picklist fields** to numeric codes using `crm-entity-schema` skill.
2. For `create_milestone`, all four milestone-view fields are **mandatory** — `workloadType`, `deliveredBy`, `preferredAzureRegion`, `azureCapacityType`.
3. If the user's value doesn't match, call `get_milestone_field_options({ field: "..." })`.
4. **Never guess a numeric code.**
5. Show resolved label alongside numeric code in confirmation packet.

### Required confirmation packet (must be shown to user)
- Role being applied
- Customer/account name
- Opportunity name + CRM link
- Milestone/task name + CRM link
- Current values relevant to the change
- Proposed new values (with picklist labels)
- Why the change is needed
- Expected impact and any risk

### SE Activity Tracking: Create-and-Close (Mandatory for SE role)

When the active role is **SE**, every `create_task` MUST be paired with an immediate `close_task` in the same confirmation packet. SE tasks are **activity records** (completed work), not open work items.

- Present as a single atomic operation: "Create and close task: [description]".
- The confirmation packet shows both the create and close as one proposed action.
- Approval covers both operations — no separate confirm for the close.
- If the SE describes a **future/planned** activity, do NOT create a task. Advise recording it after the activity is performed.

### Confirmation language
Ask for explicit approval: "Please confirm this update is correct. Reply: `approve` to proceed or `revise` to change details."

Rules:
- Do not perform write-intent calls in the same response that first proposes changes.
- If any identity field is missing, stop and ask for it.
- For multi-record changes, list each record and require approval for the full set.

### Staged response rendering (mandatory)
When a write-intent tool returns a staged operation:
- Show the staged summary to the user, including current state, proposed change, and record link(s).
- Include the operation ID and ask explicitly for approval (`approve` / `revise`).
- Do not collapse the staged output into a one-line summary.
- If more than one operation is staged, call `list_pending_operations` and present each pending diff before asking for approval.

## 4) Safety and Auditability
- Re-state identifiers before executing write-intent operations.
- Prefer smallest possible change set.
- After each write, return a concise result summary and follow-up verification read.
